from module import myFunc


'''
** if __name__ == '__main__' in python **

'__name__' evaluates to the name of the module in python from where the program is ran.

If the the module is being run directly from the command line, the '__name__' is set to string '__main__' , Thus, this behaviour is used to check whether the module is run directly or imported to another file.
